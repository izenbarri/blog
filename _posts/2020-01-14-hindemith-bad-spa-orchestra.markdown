The Overture to the _Flying Dutchman_ as Sight-read by a Bad Spa Orchestra at 7 in the Morning by the Well (_Ouvertüre zum „Fliegenden Holländer“, wie sie eine schlechte Kurkapelle morgens um 7 am Brunnen vom Blatt spielt_) is a piece by Paul Hindemith from 1925 and is pretty much... that.

It’s a parody rendition of the _Flying Dutchman Overture_ by Wagner, as it would be played by a very bad and presumably very tired string quartet. You can also guess that the imagined spa attendees pretty much ignore what’s going on, treating Wagner as some kind of annoying muzak (which given Wagner’s pretentious ways, is a though very amusing on itself).

The result is… extremely funny.

Ironically enough, to achieve this intentionally terrible result, Hindemith wrote a meticulously complicated score. This score demands from the musicians a lot of _technical competence_ to be played ...uh... properly wrong. The score asks for weird tempos, non-obvious rythms and unexpected turns, it's not easy to follow. Also note: at 6″12, the music devolves in some weird Waltz, completely unrelated to Wagner.

And because History is generally terrible, I can’t help noticing that this is a German composer mocking Wagner in… the 20’s? Hindemith was personally denounced by Goebbels in 1934 and his music was banned in 1936, but he apparently tried to win some favor with the Nazis for a while but wasn’t very successful at that? (I’m just reading his Wikipedia article now, so please, please, please, don’t take my word for it). So yeah, there’s that. Just to be clear: Hindemith’s “degenerate” music was some other more important work of his, not this silly piece, but I can guess that didn’t help anyway.
