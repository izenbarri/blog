The “Farewell” Symphony (_Abschiedssinfonie_, Symphony no. 45 in F♯ minor) was written by Hadyn in 1772, when he worked for a Hungarian prince by the name of Esterházy Miklós. In the Summer of 1772 the prince took his personal orchestra (because of course he had his own personal orchestra), alongside Hadyn, to his Summer Palace, Eszterháza (because of course he had multiple palaces), in rural Hungary.

However, instead of going back home at the expected date, he kept postponing the return home to Eisenstadt, Austria (all part of the same Habsburg Empire back then), and the musicians started to become homesick. This issue was brought up to Hadyn, that, instead of talking the prince directly, did what any normal person would do in his place — wrote a symphony… with a twist.

(that was before Beethoven… symphonies back then were relatively cheap and not someone’s life and blood)

In the last movement, in the adagio finale, the musicians leave the stage, one-by-one, until only two violins are left (one of them played by Hadyn himself). The story tells us that the prince got the message and started preparing the return trip on the very next day.

The video below is the Symphony’s fourth movement, performed at the Vienna Philharmonic’s New Year’s Eve concerto. If you’re in a hurry, it gets funny after 4″15.

I watched this video for the first time about a year ago and enjoyed it very much. However, when I looked for it again to post here I’ve realized that the conductor (and comedian) is no one but the Argentinian Daniel Barenboim, one of the most important conductors alive, which makes it even more amusing.
