The “Farewell” Symphony (_Abschiedssinfonie_, Symphony no. 45 in F♯ minor) was written by Joseph Haydn in 1772, as a diplomatic (and perhaps a bit acid) request to his then employer, prince Esterházy Miklós, on behalf of the musicians of the prince's personal orchestra.

This is how the story goes. In 1772, Haydn was working for a Hungarian prince, Esterházy Miklós, of the powerful Esterházy family, as composer and conductor of the prince's personal orchestra (because of course he had his own personal orchestra). In the summer, the prince moved to his Summer Palace, Eszterháza (because of course he had multiple palaces), in rural Hungary, accompanied by his personal orchestra, going back home to to Eisenstadt, Austria (all part of the same Habsburg Empire back then), after a few weeks.

That year, however, instead of going back home at the expected date, he kept postponing the return, and the musicians started to become homesick and agitated. This issue was brought up to Haydn (the director of the orchestra), that, instead of talking the prince directly, did what any normal person would do in his place -- he wrote a symphony.

A few days later, the symphony was played to the prince and his entourage (that was before Beethoven, symphonies back then were relatively cheap and not someone’s life and blood). All musicians were on the stage, each one with a candle by his side (I'm not sure if there were candles at all times, or if this is something specific to this performance, I believe the former).


The first three movements are nice and not out of the ordinary. In the last movement, however, in the adagio finale, something happens. The musicians, one by one, stop playing, extinguish his candle and leave the stage, one-by-one, until only two violins are left (one of them played by Haydn himself). The story tells us that the prince got the message and, on the very next day, started preparing the return trip.

The video below is the Symphony’s fourth movement, performed at the Vienna Philharmonic’s New Year’s Eve concerto. If you’re in a hurry, it gets funny after 4″15.

I watched this video for the first time about a year ago and enjoyed it very much. However, when I looked for it again to post here I’ve realized that the conductor (and comedian) is no one but the Argentinian Daniel Barenboim, one of the most important conductors alive, which makes it even more amusing.
